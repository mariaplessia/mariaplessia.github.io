              In this project, I will implement my own deep learning library from scratch.
              Inspired by PyTorch, my library – MyTorch – will be used to create everything from multilayer perceptrons,
              convolutional neural networks, to recurrent neural networks with gated recurrent units (GRU) and long-short
              term memory (LSTM) structures. The goal of Part 1 is to understand forward propagation, loss calculation,
              backward propagation, and gradient descent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here, I started by creating the core components of multilayer perceptrons: linear layers,
              activations, loss functions, and batch normalization. I implemented these classes in MyTorch. The requirement 
              of this project was to specifically implement the mathematics into the code, and understand how all the
              components are related. I only used numpy and no other python library.
            </p>
            <p>
              In terms of the mathematics, I coded the equations needed to build a simple Neural Network
              Layer. This includes forward and backward propagation for the activations, loss functions, linear layers, and
              batch normalization.
