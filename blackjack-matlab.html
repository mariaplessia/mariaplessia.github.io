              This GUI is a graphics user interface designed on MATLAB, on which the card game Blackjack was developed to demonstrate
              programming versatility and range.

            <h2>Key Features:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Use of ui-graphics (uifigure, uibutton,
uiaxes, uiimage) to create an
interactive, dynamic display that
gives the user the ability to click on
buttons on the display.</li>
                <li>The program shows realistic images
of the first two player cards dealt.
randomly for every round.</li>
                <li>The exact cards are displayed in the
command window (rank & suit, e.g.
Ace of Spades).</li>
                <li>The program plays Händel’s
Hallelujah when the player wins and
produces a gong sound when the
player loses.</li>
              </ul>
          
        </br></br></br>
          <h2>Key Functionalities:</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Scores were computed twice so that the player can see their score both as it
is and when counting the Ace as 11. Both scores are printed every time the
player gets a new card so they can make appropriate decisions for their next
move.</li>
              <li>If the player exceeded 20 points, the program would break out of the while
loop and go on to check the win conditions, which were structured in a
specific order. Before going to the win conditions, the program would choose
the most favorable score out of the two scores (with Aces as 1 or 11). Then if
the player had 21 points, as long as the dealer did not also have 21 points, the
player would have Blackjack and therefore win. If the dealer had Blackjack,
this was taken care of by the dealer logic code. </li>
              <li>The winner was determined by choosing the most favorable score in the
playerscore and dealerscore matrices and then a series of if statement in this
order: if dealerscore = 21, if playerscore >21, if dealerscore >21, if playerscore
= 21, if playerscore = dealerscore, if playerscore and dealerscore both < 21
(and then the conditions for this case).</li>
              <li>The stay and hit rectangles on the screen are
actual buttons. The cards displayed on the screen
and the command window output above are
random and will vary every time. The output above
is before the player hits any of the buttons, as the
uifigure is set to close when the game finishes.</li>
              </ol>

          </br></br></br>

          <h2>Example output from a program run</h2>

          <code>
            Player Card 1: Jack of Spades
            Dealer Card 1: 5 of Spades
            Player Card 2: 8 of Diamonds
            Dealer Card 2: Queen of Spades
            Player Score: 18
            Player Score counting Aces as 11: 18
