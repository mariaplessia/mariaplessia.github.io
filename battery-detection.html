              The Automatic Waste Battery Sorting program is a project developed as part of a team within the Computer Vision for Engineers class (24-678) at Carnegie Mellon University. 
              The development stack makes use of OpenCV within a Python environment.

          <p>
            Although ML methods, and particularly CNNs, are a robust way to solve detection problems, their use presents a challenge in this particular context. 
            Our program's aim is to be able to identify batteries without depending on the particular branding appearance, as what is important in waste battery separation is
            grouping same types of batteries together, which is rather based on their shape and size. Employing CNNs would require the creation of a new training dataset
            that would need to capture all lighting and position possibilities in a container of batteries, which is neither efficient nor robust. That is because supervised learning 
            requires labeled training data. In contrast, unsupervised learning does not. Particularly, we identified that using depth as the primary factor for grouping,
            as color is not a reliable marker of battery type, as there is no consistency among different brands, and inconsistent lighting & reflection changes color values.
