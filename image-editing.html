              The goal of this task was to find a good combination of smoothing and sharpening filters and the order of applying 
              them to improve each image and make it as close as possible to the ground truth. I first displayed the original blurry 
              image, and then I started implementing my solution by splitting the method into four sections according to each image, 
              so that I could customize the order of the filters.

              <br/>
            </p>
            
            <p>
              For the first image, I found that implementing a Gaussian filter first got rid of the noise in the blue areas, which was otherwise 
              intensified by all other filters. I did two convolutions of a 3x3 median filter with a sharpening filter in-between to 
              smooth out the slightly spiked noise; I found that although 1 such filter of higher size had great smoothing effect, the 
              little ripples of the cloud would also get smoothed out, so I chose this implementation to save the original edges of the 
              clouds. I finished with a bilateral filter to smooth out the remaining noise but ensure that the sharpened edges are maintained.

              alt="Project 1 part 1 pic"
              class="about-pic method"
              />

            
            <p>
              For the second image, I started a median blur with a kernel size of 5, as it was full of spiked noise. Not all of it was removed but using 
              a higher kernel size compromised the blurring too much, so I followed by a sharpening filter and another median blur of kernel 3, to 
              remove the little remaining spiked noise.

              alt="Project 1 part 1 pic"
              class="about-pic method"
              />
            
            <p>
              For the third image, I also started a median blur with a kernel size of 3, as it was full of spiked noise. Then, I implemented a pass 
              of a sharpening filter, and to remove the slight noise that was caused without affecting the edges I followed with a bilateral filter.

              class="about-pic method"
              />

            <p>
             For the fourth image, I started by sharpening it first, as the primary issue was the blurriness rather than the noise. Then, I followed 
              with a bilateral filter to smooth out the noise but preserve the edges.
